Known limitations
-----------------

"NYI:" comments mark tests that have been commented out since Riposte does not yet support them.

"DIFF:" comments mark tests that have been commented out since Riposte's behavior differs from R by design.

We wrap some statements in () to force R to echo.

Riposte doesn't match R's function output format so we have formatted the
function definitions to match R explicitly.
