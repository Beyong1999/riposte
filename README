A Quick Riposte, a fast interpreter for R.

Justin Talbot <jtalbot@stanford.edu>


Compiling riposte
-----------------
1. Install R and make sure the R executable is available on the path.

2. Install the Boehm GC. Available in macports, `port install boehmgc`.

3. Run make in the riposte directory

4. Execute ./riposte to start


Limitations
-----------
Riposte is in heavy development. Many things haven't been implemented
and many things have been implemented incorrectly. Use with caution.
Fixes welcome.
