Compiling riposte
-----------------
1. Run make in the riposte directory, or `make release` for the optimized version

2. Execute ./riposte to start


Limitations
-----------
Riposte is in heavy development. Many things haven't been implemented
and many things have been implemented incorrectly. Use with caution.
Fixes welcome.
