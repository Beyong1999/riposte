Riposte, a fast interpreter and JIT for R.

Justin Talbot <jtalbot@stanford.edu>

We only do development on OSX and Linux. It's unlikely that our JIT will work on Windows.

Compiling riposte
-----------------
1. Install the Boehm GC. Available in macports, `port install boehmgc`.
   Install rlwrap. Available in macports, `port install rlwrap`.

2. Run `make release` in the riposte directory, or `make debug` for the debug version

3. Execute ./riposte to start


Flags
-----

-j # 		: start with # worker threads (defaults to 1, set to the number of cores on your machine)
-f <filename>	: execute R script in <filename>
-v 		: verbose debug output for the vector trace recorder and JIT


Limitations
-----------
Riposte is in heavy development. Many things haven't been implemented
and many things have been implemented incorrectly. Use with caution.
Fixes welcome.
