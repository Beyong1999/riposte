Justin Talbot <jtalbot@stanford.edu>


Compiling riposte
-----------------
1. Install the Boehm GC. Available in macports, `port install boehmgc`.
   (Optional) Install rlwrap. Available in macports, `port install rlwrap`.

2. Run make in the riposte directory, or `make release` for the optimized version

3. Execute ./riposte to start


Limitations
-----------
Riposte is in heavy development. Many things haven't been implemented
and many things have been implemented incorrectly. Use with caution.
Fixes welcome.
