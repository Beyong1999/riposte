Compiling riposte
-----------------
1. Install the Boehm GC. Available in macports, `port install boehmgc`.
   (Optional) Install rlwrap. Available in macports, `port install rlwrap`.

2. Run `make release` in the riposte directory, or `make debug` for the debug version

3. Execute ./riposte to start


Flags
-----

-j # 		: start with # worker threads (defaults to 1, set to the number of cores on your machine)
-f <filename>	: execute R script in <filename>
-v 		: verbose debug output for the vector trace recorder and JIT


Runtime control
---------------

Running trace.config(0) turns off the vector JIT, trace.config(1) turns on the recorder but does not JIT machine code, 
trace.config(2) (the default) turns on the JIT. 


Limitations
-----------
Riposte is in heavy development. Many things haven't been implemented
and many things have been implemented incorrectly. Use with caution.
Fixes welcome.
