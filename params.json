{"name":"Riposte","body":"### A Fast Interpreter and Vector JIT for R\r\n\r\nRiposte is an academic interpreter and JIT for the [R language](http://www.r-project.org/). Riposte is in heavy development. Many things haven't been implemented and many things have been implemented incorrectly. Use with caution. Fixes welcome.\r\n\r\nRiposte is currently developed at Stanford University by Justin Talbot (@jtalbot) and Zach DeVito (@zdevito).\r\n\r\n### Compiling Riposte\r\n\r\nWe do development on OSX and Linux. Windows compilation is completely untested and we doubt the JIT will work on Windows.\r\n\r\n1. Install the Boehm GC. Available in macports, port install boehmgc.\r\nInstall rlwrap. Available in macports, port install rlwrap.\r\n\r\n2. Run make release in the riposte directory, or make debug for the debug version\r\n\r\n3. Execute ./riposte to start\r\n\r\n### Flags\r\n\r\n`-j #`: start with `#` worker threads (defaults to `1`)\r\n\r\n`-f <filename>`: execute R script\r\n\r\n`-v`: verbose debug output for the vector trace recorder and JIT\r\n\r\n`--args`: pass arguments after `--args` to the R script\r\n\r\n### License\r\nRiposte is distributed under the [BSD 2-clause license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php).\r\n\r\nRiposte uses Eigen which is distributed under the [LGPL3 license](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
