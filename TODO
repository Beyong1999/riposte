To do list (not yet in priority order):

Big stuff:
-Garbage Collector. Replace Boehm with exact, generational garbage collector like everyone else has. Can we borrow the GC from a Javascript implementation?

-Standalone R parser. Currently we have a dependency on R to provide parsing only. Can we strip the parser out from the R distribution so we don't have that dependency? Or maybe write our own? Much of the code in R's parser appears to be necessary to deal with multi-byte character encoding schemes. Is there a parser generator out there that could handle that for us?

-R external interface. Make it possible to load and use existing R packages.


Incomplete features:
-Incomplete parameter name matching.
	f <- function(x,y,index) {...}
	f(1,2,i=5)		# i should match parameter `index`

-Warnings on too many parameters

-Warning on attempt to use missing parameter
