Moments
-variance
-skewness, kurtosis
-covariance
-use Janine Bennett method
--recurrance on lower orders, would want to avoid recomputing pieces. Does this arise elsewhere?

Matrix-matrix multiplication
-needed for decompositions

Conversion to CSR format
Sparse matrix-vector multiplication

Goal: show that idiomatic R code can run fast

Demonstrate: tracing through control flow

1) Black-Scholes
	Necessary: ifelse

2) Logistic/linear regression
	Perf: matrix*vector multiplication

3) Data cleaning pipeline (convert missing value to NA, filter NA values and compute mean and variance, compute Z-score and mark outliers, join with other data?)
	Perf: Delay scalar ops and fuse mean, variance computation

4) Sparse matrix-vector multiplication
	Necessary: take repeat count from vector (for CSR implementation)
	Perf: structured group by

5) PCA
	Necessary: summary statistics (covariance matrix), (eigenvector/values (not parallel)), change of basis (matrix*matrix, for relatively thin matrices)

6) Histogram
	Necessary: unkeyed group by

7) K-means
	Necessary: outer product
	Perf: nested reductions

8) QR-decomposition
	http://www.slideshare.net/skillsmatter/parallel-qr-decomposition

9) Bootstrap a logistic regression model
	Necessary: nested parallelism, random number generation
	Could change sample size to demonstrate load imbalance

10) Sample a mixture of gaussians
	Necessary: random number generation, normal CDF inversion

11) TPC-H Q1
	Necessary: compute cardinality of column (make factor), order by at the end?	

12) 1D gaussian blur or running average
	This would be a "bad" example, we'd 

13) Mandelbrot
	Necessary: get conditionals working

14) Ray-sphere intersection
